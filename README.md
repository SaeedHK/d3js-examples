# D3js examples

This repository contains the D3js examples that I use for learning purposes.

## How to use

To run an example, first enter a nix shell:

```
$ nix-shell
```

After building the deps, run

```
$ live-server <EXAMPLE>
```

For example run

```
$ live-server circles
```

to run the `circles` example.
